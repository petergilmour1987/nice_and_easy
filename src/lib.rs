//! ```rust
//! use nice_and_easy::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Can be used with f32...
//!     let progress: f32 = 0.5;
//!     let starting_value: f32 = 0.0;
//!     let target: f32 = 2.0;
//!     let duration: f32 = 1.0;
//!     let value: f32 = sine_in_out(progress, starting_value, target, duration);
//!     assert_eq!(value, 1.0);
//!
//!     // ...or f64
//!     let progress: f64 = 0.5;
//!     let starting_value: f64 = 0.0;
//!     let target: f64 = 2.0;
//!     let duration: f64 = 1.0;
//!     let value: f64 = quad_in_out(progress, starting_value, target, duration);
//!     assert_eq!(value, 1.0);
